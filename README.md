When i made pokemon ejs i was cleaning up my fullstack projects from bootcamp and was worried i'd reveal myself:

through the over-amount of time it would take to complete tasks and it being obvious that i didn't know enough.

(for example i was worried that if i spent 3 weeks on a login it would look better to have 1 commit on the app without any indicators of the time it takes)

Creating the first Mine-Nugget-EJS was my first project during which i was publishing changes to the app by pushing commits.

Spent some time writing and time learning audio engineering, video-editing, and making a journal website (which is down and will be republished in next.js)

The excitement of 
pushing changes makes me wish I could see all of the 'commits' i would have ever published if i looked at everything i ever did in anything

The Downside:
I do 1.5 hours of algorithms on Tuesday-wednesday during my teaching job.

I passed:

the first useCase of "TWOSUM"
2 useCases of "ROMAN TO INTEGER"
2 useCases of 'LONGEST COMMON PREFIX'

all 3 usescases of 'PALINDROME NUMBER' at work yesterday in 15 minutes.
2 usecases of 'SEARCH INSERT POSITION'

The Upside: 

the commit system is addicting and it's nice to have stats to measure by.

(i think i remember someone saying that when metrics become targets they cease being metrics so there are pokable arguments in the statement)

I do work on my break at work and it's unseen.
I already save my learnings in a color coded google docs. Why not save this?

It is the total opposite of starting ejs-pokedex and being afraid of the commits revealing me to be sub-par. 

I am not good at algorithms and i still believe it's worth tracking and it doesn't hurt to track publicly.
